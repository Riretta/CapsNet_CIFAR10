# CapsNet_CIFAR10
Configuration of CapsNet for CIFAR10 for pytorch implementation.

file = Capsule Network:

Original code from https://github.com/higgsfield/Capsule-Network-Tutorial 
The network is initialized to work with CIFAR10 dataset and reach a test accuracy of 71%.

Still working on recostruction of the image.

This implementation of Capsules with CIFAR10 is missing the ensembled models required for 89% accuracy.

file= Capsule Network with ensemble

The code is expanded with n ensembled models to improve the performance with the cifar10 images.
